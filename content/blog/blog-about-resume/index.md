To be a better developer you have practice a lot on your skills. The resume that I build is showing my skills. It was fun building this resume from scratch. I really enjoy a lot while working on this project. This resume was inspired by a blog which I saw on (https://dev.to/)
by a frontend-developer. Here a link to that blog (https://dev.to/akshar07/interviewing-for-frontend-engineering-2b3d).
PS: This is my best front-end project.

## Tech Stack used in this project.

- HTML5
- CSS
