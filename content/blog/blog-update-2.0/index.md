description: Update about the blogs.
---

It's been 4 months since I post my last blog. The blog was about me telling myself to blog regularly but I was not able to do it, not even a single blog I wrote. I had written the blog ideas but was not able to implement it. I don't know that will I ever be able to write a technical blog. Right now my primary goal is to be a frontend developer in a good company and I am preparing for it. On 13th Oct I enroll in the most amazing course I bought i.e Fullstack developer on crio.do platform. It is a very good platform who are in a tutorial bubble and want to get rid of it. It is a project-based learning platform. The overall experience of the platform is very overwhelming. The programs on the platform are so much well organized that you will judge yourself how much you don't know about anything.
