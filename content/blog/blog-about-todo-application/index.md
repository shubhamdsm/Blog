On a journey to become a front-end developer you have to do a lot of projects to clear concepts. So I build a TODO Application. I followed a Javascript Course which was on youtube by Hitesh Choudhary here a link to his youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXgGY0wkgOzynnHvSEVmE3A). It is a very good for beginner who are just started with javacript. Follow along with the course you will learn a lot from the course.The CSS of the project is copied from the internet because I was more focused on Javascript. Will better style the project when I get time for it.

## Tech Stack used in this project.
